sales trends, customer preferences, and profitability across different branches, cities, and product 
lines. This report also sheds light on customer satisfaction levels to guide improvements in product 
offerings and service quality.

decisions, such as inventory management, product pricing, and customer retention strategies. It 
provides a holistic view of branch performance, product demand, and customer preferences, 
empowering better resource allocation, targeted marketing, and profit optimization.
